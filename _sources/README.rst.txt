Features
========

* Template code for various generative models such as GANs, VAEs, etc.
* Easy-to-modify structures for quick customization and experimentation.
* Ideal for educational purposes and prototyping new generative model ideas.

Usage
=====

``gen_model_toys`` serves as a template for creating and modifying generative models. It contains GANs, VAE, Discrete NF, Flow Matching, Continuous NF, DDPM.
Check the ``__main__.py`` file for the possible argument configurations.
So in the end run ``python -m gen_model_playground --{args}`` to run the code, e.g. ``python -m gen_model_playground``.
Please refer to the documentation within each model template for specific modification tips and best practices.
